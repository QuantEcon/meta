# Style Guide Checker Action

A GitHub Action that uses AI to review QuantEcon lectures for compliance with the [QuantEcon Style Guide](../../copilot-qe-style-guide.md) and automatically suggests or applies improvements.

## Features

- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses OpenAI GPT-4 to understand style guide context and provide intelligent suggestions
- üìù **Two Operating Modes**: 
  - **PR Mode**: Reviews only changed files in pull requests
  - **Full Mode**: Reviews all files in the repository (for scheduled runs)
- üéØ **Confidence-Based Actions**:
  - **PR Mode**: 
    - High-confidence suggestions on changed lines use GitHub's suggestion feature (click to apply)
    - Suggestions on unchanged lines are provided as regular comments
    - All suggestions are transparent and require reviewer approval
  - **Full Mode**: High-confidence changes are auto-committed; others become review suggestions
- üö´ **File Exclusion**: Supports regex patterns to exclude files from review
- üìä **Detailed Reporting**: Provides comprehensive summaries and metrics

## Usage

### Comment-Based Trigger (Recommended)

The most user-friendly way to use this action is with comment-based triggering. Users can trigger style guide reviews by commenting on a PR with specific trigger phrases:

```yaml
name: Style Guide Review (Comment Triggered)
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  check-trigger:
    if: github.event.issue.pull_request && (contains(github.event.comment.body, '/style-check') || contains(github.event.comment.body, '@quantecon-style-guide'))
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Parse Comment Trigger
    outputs:
      should-run: ${{ steps.parse.outputs.should-run }}
    steps:
      - name: Parse comment for trigger phrases
        id: parse
        run: |
          COMMENT_BODY="${{ github.event.comment.body }}"
          if echo "$COMMENT_BODY" | grep -q "/style-check\|@quantecon-style-guide"; then
            echo "should-run=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          else
            echo "should-run=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          fi

  style-check:
    needs: check-trigger
    if: needs.check-trigger.outputs.should-run == 'true'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout PR
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          ref: ${{ format('refs/pull/{0}/head', github.event.issue.number) }}
          
      - name: Run style guide checker
        uses: QuantEcon/meta/.github/actions/style-guide-checker@main
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          openai-api-key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
          docs: 'lectures'
          mode: 'pr'
```

**Trigger phrases:**
- `/style-check` - Simple command-style trigger
- `@quantecon-style-guide` - Mention-style trigger

Users can comment either phrase on any PR to trigger a style guide review.

### Automatic PR Review

```yaml
name: Style Guide Review (Automatic)
on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'lectures/**/*.md'

jobs:
  style-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: Run style guide checker
        uses: QuantEcon/meta/.github/actions/style-guide-checker@main
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          openai-api-key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
          docs: 'lectures'
          mode: 'pr'
```

### Scheduled Full Review

```yaml
name: Weekly Style Review
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'  # Every Monday at 9 AM UTC

jobs:
  full-style-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: Run full style guide review
        uses: QuantEcon/meta/.github/actions/style-guide-checker@main
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          openai-api-key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
          docs: 'lectures'

## Configuration Examples

### Custom Style Guide Location

```yaml
- name: Style check with custom guide
  uses: QuantEcon/meta/.github/actions/style-guide-checker@main
  with:
    style-guide: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MyOrg/docs/main/style-guide.md'
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    openai-api-key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
```

### Exclude Specific Files

```yaml
- name: Style check with exclusions
  uses: QuantEcon/meta/.github/actions/style-guide-checker@main
  with:
    exclude-files: 'lectures/tmp/.*,.*_old\.md,lectures/archive/.*'
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    openai-api-key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
```

### Rule-Based Mode (No OpenAI)

```yaml
- name: Rule-based style check
  uses: QuantEcon/meta/.github/actions/style-guide-checker@main
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    # No openai-api-key provided - uses rule-based fallback
```

## How It Works

### 1. File Discovery
- **PR Mode**: Analyzes only files changed in the current pull request
- **Full Mode**: Analyzes all `.md` files in the specified `docs` directory
- Applies exclusion patterns to filter out unwanted files

### 2. Style Analysis
- **AI-Powered (Recommended)**: Uses OpenAI GPT-4 with the style guide as context to provide intelligent, contextual suggestions
- **Rule-Based Fallback**: Uses predefined rules for common style issues when OpenAI is not available

### 3. Confidence-Based Actions
- **PR Mode**: All suggestions are provided as GitHub review comments for transparency and reviewer control
  - **High Confidence on Changed Lines**: Uses GitHub's suggestion feature for one-click application (requires line to be part of the PR diff)
  - **High Confidence on Unchanged Lines**: Regular comments with suggested changes
  - **Medium/Low Confidence**: Regular review comments with suggested changes
- **Full Mode**: 
  - **High Confidence**: Changes are auto-committed to maintain consistency
  - **Medium/Low Confidence**: Suggested as review comments if in PR context

### 4. GitHub Suggestions Integration
The action intelligently determines which suggestions can use GitHub's native suggestion feature:

- **Diff-Based Suggestions**: For lines that are part of the PR diff, high-confidence suggestions use the `````suggestion` format that can be applied with one click
- **Non-Diff Suggestions**: For lines not changed in the PR, suggestions are provided as regular comments with the recommended changes
- **Transparent Process**: All suggestions require explicit reviewer approval - no automatic commits in PR mode

### 4. Reporting
- Creates detailed PR comments with summaries and metrics
- Provides GitHub Action outputs for integration with other workflows

## Style Rules Checked

The action checks for compliance with the [QuantEcon Style Guide](../../copilot-qe-style-guide.md), including:

### Writing Conventions
- Clarity and conciseness
- One sentence paragraphs
- Proper logical flow
- Appropriate capitalization

### Code Style
- PEP8 compliance
- Unicode symbols for Greek letters (Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥, etc.)
- Modern timing patterns (`qe.Timer()`)
- Proper package installation practices

### Math Notation
- LaTeX formatting standards
- Equation numbering and referencing
- Matrix and vector notation

### Figure Formatting
- Caption formatting and placement
- Figure referencing
- Matplotlib styling guidelines

### Document Structure
- Heading capitalization rules
- Proper linking syntax
- Citation formatting

## Examples

### Example PR Comment

When the action runs on a pull request, it creates a summary comment like:

```markdown
## üìù Style Guide Review Summary

**Files reviewed:** 3
**Total suggestions:** 8

**Suggestions provided:**
- üî• **2** high-confidence suggestions (GitHub suggestions - click to apply)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **4** medium-confidence suggestions  
- üí° **2** low-confidence suggestions

**Suggestion breakdown:**
- **High confidence**: Ready-to-apply suggestions using GitHub's suggestion feature
- **Medium confidence**: Recommended changes that may need minor adjustments
- **Low confidence**: Optional improvements for consideration

All suggestions are based on the QuantEcon Style Guide. High-confidence suggestions can be applied with a single click using GitHub's suggestion feature for transparency and reviewer control.
```

### Example High-Confidence Suggestion

High-confidence suggestions use GitHub's suggestion feature for easy application:

```markdown
**Style Guide Suggestion (high confidence)**

Use Unicode Œ± instead of 'alpha' for better mathematical notation

**Rule category:** variable_naming

```suggestion
def utility_function(c, Œ±=0.5, Œ≤=0.95):
```
```

### Example Medium/Low-Confidence Suggestion

Other suggestions appear as regular review comments:

```markdown
**Style Guide Suggestion (medium confidence)**

Consider improving paragraph clarity by breaking into shorter sentences

**Suggested change:**
```markdown
This sentence is too long and contains multiple ideas. It should be split for better readability.
```

**Rule category:** writing_conventions
```

## Setup Requirements

### 1. GitHub Token
The action requires a GitHub token with appropriate permissions:
- For public repositories: `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` (automatic)
- For private repositories: Personal access token with `repo` scope

### 2. OpenAI API Key (Recommended)
For AI-powered analysis, add your OpenAI API key as a repository secret:
1. Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
2. Add a new secret named `OPENAI_API_KEY`
3. Paste your OpenAI API key as the value

Without OpenAI, the action falls back to rule-based checking with limited capabilities.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No files to review"**
- Check that the `docs` path exists and contains `.md` files
- Verify exclusion patterns aren't too broad
- In PR mode, ensure there are actual changes to markdown files

**"OpenAI API not available"**
- Verify the `OPENAI_API_KEY` secret is correctly set
- Check API key has sufficient credits/quota
- Action will fall back to rule-based checking

**"Failed to create PR review suggestions"**
- Ensure the GitHub token has appropriate permissions
- Check that the action is running in a PR context for PR mode

### Debug Mode

Add debug logging by setting the `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` secret to `true` in your repository settings.
