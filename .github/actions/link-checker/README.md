# AI-Powered Link Checker Action

This GitHub Action scans HTML files for web links and validates them, providing AI-powered suggestions for improvements. It's designed to replace traditional link checkers like `lychee` with enhanced functionality that not only detects broken links but also suggests better alternatives using AI-driven analysis.

## Features

- **Smart Link Validation**: Checks external web links in HTML files with configurable timeout and redirect handling
- **Enhanced Robustness**: Intelligent detection of bot-blocked sites to reduce false positives
- **AI-Powered Suggestions**: Provides intelligent recommendations for broken or redirected links
- **Two Scanning Modes**: Full project scan or PR-specific changed files only  
- **Configurable Status Codes**: Define which HTTP status codes to silently report (e.g., 403, 503)
- **Redirect Detection**: Identifies and suggests updates for redirected links
- **GitHub Integration**: Creates issues, PR comments, and workflow artifacts
- **MyST Markdown Support**: Works with Jupyter Book projects by scanning HTML output
- **Performance Optimized**: Respectful rate limiting, improved timeouts, and efficient scanning

  uses: QuantEcon/meta/.github/actions/link-checker@main
  with:
    html-path: './_build/html'
    mode: 'full'
    silent-codes: '403,503,429'
    fail-on-broken: 'false'
    ai-suggestions: 'true'
    create-issue: 'true'
    issue-title: 'Link Check Report - Broken Links Found'
    create-artifact: 'true'
    artifact-name: 'detailed-link-report'
    notify: 'team-lead,docs-maintainer'
    timeout: '30'
    max-redirects: '5'
```

## False Positive Reduction

The action includes intelligent logic to reduce false positives for legitimate sites:

### Bot Blocking Detection
- **Major Sites**: Automatically detects common sites that block automated requests (Netflix, Amazon, Facebook, etc.)
- **Encoding Issues**: Identifies encoding errors that often indicate bot protection
- **Status Code Analysis**: Recognizes rate limiting (429) and bot blocking patterns
- **Silent Reporting**: Marks likely bot-blocked sites as silent instead of broken

### Improved Robustness
- **Browser-like Headers**: Uses realistic browser headers to reduce blocking
- **Increased Timeout**: Default 45-second timeout for slow-loading legitimate sites
- **Smart Error Handling**: Distinguishes between genuine broken links and temporary blocks

### AI Suggestion Filtering
- **Constructive Suggestions**: Only suggests fixes, not removals, for legitimate domains
- **Manual Review**: Suggests manual verification for unknown domains instead of automatic removal
- **Domain Whitelist**: Recognizes trusted domains (GitHub, Python.org, etc.) and handles them appropriately

## AI-Powered Suggestions

The action includes intelligent analysis that can suggest:

### Automatic Fixes
- **HTTPS Upgrades**: Detects `http://` links that should be `https://`
- **GitHub Branch Updates**: Finds `/master/` links that should be `/main/`
- **Documentation Migrations**: Suggests updated URLs for moved documentation sites
- **Version Updates**: Recommends newer versions of deprecated documentation

### Redirect Optimization
- **Final Destination**: Suggests updating redirected links to their final destination
- **Performance**: Eliminates unnecessary redirect chains
- **Reliability**: Reduces dependency on redirect services

### Example AI Suggestions Output:
```
🤖 http://docs.python.org/2.7/library/urllib.html
   Issue: Broken link (Status: 404)
   💡 version_update: https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html
      Reason: Python 2.7 is deprecated, consider Python 3 documentation

🤖 http://github.com/user/repo/blob/master/README.md
   Issue: Redirected 1 times
   💡 redirect_update: https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/README.md
      Reason: GitHub default branch changed from master to main
```

## How It Works

1. **File Discovery**: Scans HTML files in the specified directory
2. **Link Extraction**: Uses BeautifulSoup to extract all external links
3. **Link Validation**: Checks each link with configurable timeout and redirect handling
4. **AI Analysis**: Applies rule-based AI to suggest improvements
5. **Reporting**: Creates detailed reports with actionable suggestions

### Scanning Modes

#### Full Mode (`mode: 'full'`)
- Scans all HTML files in the target directory
- Ideal for scheduled weekly scans
- Comprehensive coverage of entire project

#### Changed Mode (`mode: 'changed'`)
- Only scans HTML files that changed in the current PR
- Efficient for PR-triggered workflows
- Falls back to full scan if no changes detected

## Configuration

### Silent Status Codes

Configure which HTTP status codes should be reported without failing:

```yaml
silent-codes: '403,503,429,502'
```

Common codes to consider:
- `403`: Forbidden (often due to bot detection)
- `503`: Service Unavailable (temporary outages)
- `429`: Too Many Requests (rate limiting)
- `502`: Bad Gateway (temporary server issues)

### Performance Tuning

```yaml
timeout: '30'        # Timeout per link in seconds
max-redirects: '5'   # Maximum redirects to follow
```

## Integration Examples

### Replacing Lychee

**Before (using lychee):**
```yaml
- name: Link Checker
  uses: lycheeverse/lychee-action@v2
  with:
    fail: false
    args: --accept 403,503 *.html
```

**After (using AI-powered link checker):**
```yaml
- name: AI-Powered Link Checker
  uses: QuantEcon/meta/.github/actions/link-checker@main
  with:
    html-path: '.'
    fail-on-broken: 'false'
    silent-codes: '403,503'
    ai-suggestions: 'true'
    create-issue: 'true'
```

### MyST Markdown Projects

For Jupyter Book projects:

```yaml
- name: Build Jupyter Book
  run: jupyter-book build lectures/

- name: Check links in built documentation
  uses: QuantEcon/meta/.github/actions/link-checker@main
  with:
    html-path: './lectures/_build/html'
    mode: 'full'
    ai-suggestions: 'true'
```

## Outputs

Use action outputs in subsequent workflow steps:

```yaml
- name: Check links
  id: link-check
  uses: QuantEcon/meta/.github/actions/link-checker@main
  with:
    fail-on-broken: 'false'

- name: Report results
  run: |
    echo "Broken links: ${{ steps.link-check.outputs.broken-link-count }}"
    echo "Redirects: ${{ steps.link-check.outputs.redirect-count }}"
    echo "AI suggestions available: ${{ steps.link-check.outputs.ai-suggestions != '' }}"
```

## Permissions

Required workflow permissions depend on features used:

```yaml

## Best Practices

1. **Weekly Scans**: Use scheduled workflows for comprehensive link checking
2. **PR Validation**: Use changed-file mode for efficient PR validation
3. **Status Code Configuration**: Adjust silent codes based on your links' typical behavior
4. **AI Suggestions**: Review and apply AI suggestions to improve link quality
5. **Issue Management**: Use automatic issue creation for tracking broken links
6. **Performance**: Set appropriate timeouts based on your link destinations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Timeout Errors**: Increase `timeout` value for slow-responding sites (default is now 45s)
2. **False Positives**: The action automatically detects major sites that block bots (Netflix, Amazon, etc.)
3. **Rate Limiting**: Add `429` to `silent-codes` for rate-limited sites
4. **Bot Blocking**: Legitimate sites blocking automated requests are automatically handled gracefully
5. **Large Repositories**: Use `changed` mode for PR workflows

### False Positive Mitigation

If legitimate links are being flagged as broken:

1. **Check if it's a major site**: Netflix, Amazon, Facebook, etc. are automatically detected as likely bot-blocked
2. **Increase timeout**: Use `timeout: '60'` for slower sites like tutorials or educational content
3. **Add to silent codes**: If a site consistently returns specific error codes, add them to `silent-codes`
4. **Review AI suggestions**: The action provides constructive fix suggestions rather than suggesting removal

### Debug Output

The action provides detailed logging including:
- Number of files scanned
- Links found per file
- Status codes and errors
- AI suggestion reasoning

## Migration from Lychee

This action can directly replace `lychee` workflows with enhanced functionality:

1. Replace `lycheeverse/lychee-action` with this action
2. Update input parameters (see comparison above)  
3. Add AI suggestions and issue creation features
4. Configure silent status codes as needed

The enhanced AI capabilities provide value beyond basic link checking by suggesting improvements and maintaining link quality over time.
